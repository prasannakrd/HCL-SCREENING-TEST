1. How do you design an application with JMS messaging?

 JMS uses four interfaces to design.
Connection-to create session.
Session-provides methods used to create.
Message producer-send messages
Message Consumer-recieve messages

2.How do you handle exception in JMS consumers and how to you recover?

By creating a Session

3. How do you implement LRU or MRU cache?

An LRU Cache is generally implemented by using a combination of a Hash Table and a Linked List.Doubly Linked List is 
used to store list of pages with most recently used page at the start of the list. So, as more pages are added to the 
list, least recently used pages are moved to the end of the list.

4.   How would you implement Executor Service?

java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService with fixed thread pool used to execute list of tasks. 
My list of tasks will typically be around 80 - 150 and If we want we can  limit the number of threads running at any time. 

5. Describe singleton design pattern – how would you implement?

There are so many design patterns available in java.Singleton pattern is one of the easiest design patterns in Java. 
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object
 gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to
 instantiate the object of the class.

6.   Describe properties of Java String..??

Java String is an immutable object.Immutable object is a object that we cannot modify or change any of the values. 
Once java String object created it cannot be modified to some other object or a different String.If we want to make 
some changes to sequence of characters we should use StringBuffer. There are multiple ways to make an object immutable. 
Simple a way is to make all the attributes of that class as final.Java String has all fields are marked as final.
